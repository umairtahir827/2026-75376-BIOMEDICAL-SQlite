# Biomedical SQLite Database
This project is designed to manage biomedical study data using an SQLite database. It stores patient information, study details, and corresponding results in a structured format, allowing easy access, organization, and analysis of biomedical data. The database helps maintain records efficiently and supports queries on patients, their studies, and study outcomes.
The database consists of three main tables: Patients, Studies, and Results. Each patient can have multiple studies, and each study can have multiple results, establishing a one-to-many relationship between patients and studies, and between studies and results. The Python script (`main.py` or `biomed db.py`) interacts with the database to create tables, insert data, and retrieve information. To run the code, ensure Python is installed, place the optional `python viva solve` file in the same folder as the script, and execute it using `.python viva solve`; the script will automatically create or update the database as needed.
